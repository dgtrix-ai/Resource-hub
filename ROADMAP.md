  - [x] Implement a basic validation system for custom platform inputs (Test Connection)
  - [x] Store custom platform configurations in local storage
- [x] Provide in-app documentation for integrating new platforms

## Phase 3: User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop functionality for reordering resources
- [ ] Implement dark mode toggle
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Create a guided tour or onboarding process for new users
- [x] Implement a user-friendly interface for managing platform integrations
- [ ] Add error boundaries to gracefully handle and display errors

  - [ ] Implement a drag-and-drop interface for building search queries
  - [ ] Support logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) in the query builder
  - [ ] Add ability to save and reuse custom search queries

## Phase 4: Data Management and Sync
- [ ] Implement data export functionality (JSON, CSV)
- [ ] Add data import feature for previously exported data
- [ ] Implement data sync with cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox)
- [ ] Add ability to sync custom platform configurations across devices

## Phase 5: Integration and Extensibility
